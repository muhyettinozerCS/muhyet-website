        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          MSuperAudit <strong>does not collect</strong> or share any personal
          data with third parties. All information entered in the forms,
          including photos or notes, remains on the userâ€™s device until the user
          manually exports it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data transmission occurs only when the user chooses to send a report

        <h2>3. Photos and Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>
          The application may request permission to use the camera for photo
          capture or access the photo library. These permissions are used solely
          for audit documentation and are only triggered with the userâ€™s
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photos are stored locally on the device and are included in reports
          only if the user chooses to share them via email.
